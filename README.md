# MachineLearning_Yelp-Predictor

We will use a Multiple Linear Regression model to investigate what factors most affect a restaurant's Yelp rating and predict the Yelp rating for any restaurant!

The Yelp Rating Predictor project is part of Codeacademy Data Science Career Path
This is the cumulative project for Linear Regression.

Dataset of different restaurant features and their Yelp rating
yelp_business.json: establishment data regarding location and attributes for all businesses in the dataset
yelp_review.json: Yelp review metadata by business
yelp_user.json: user profile metadata by business
yelp_checkin.json: online checkin metadata by business
yelp_tip.json: tip metadata by business
yelp_photo.json: photo metadata by business
